# knowledge-library
Articles, documents, research papers, manuals, guides and anything else I find interesting pertaining to Software Engineering.

Why do I have a separate ReadMe from the main library file? My thinking here is that if I have a Markdown list, I can open it via a web browser, say on my phone (maybe I even put this on a Github Pages link).

However, my other thinking here is to create a separate JSON file that I can use in a little demo app to open the links in their respective native application (YouTube vs PDF viewer vs Web Browser).

Just a thought at this stage, so watch this space :).
